# OSSU-Curriculum

[![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

Overview and tracking completion of the [OSSU curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). All completed or ongoing courses have their respective repos which have been nested here under `.\src\` as submodules.

## Courses

The following is an exhaustive list of the courses I have completed or intend to complete in linear order. Courses that don't belong to the Computer Science curriculum will be labeled as such with an arrow (`<-`). Courses which I might not take or decide to drop half-way, will be marked with a question mark (`?`).

#### Advanced Math

- [ ] Essence of Linear Algebra
- [ ] Linear Algebra
- [ ] Introduction to Numerical Methods
- [ ] Introduction to Formal Logic
- [ ] Probability

### Final Project

-  [ ] `?`

This would conclude an equivalent undergraduate in Computer Science. I have taken many other courses relevant to computer science (mostly from my BSc. and MSc. in industrial engineering) that I didn't bother to include because thay predate this commitment to formally educating myself in these topics.

### Advanced Extras

This much is out of scope for now but will consider adding a few later on. A [fine resource](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/courses.md) for OSSUians, by OSSUians.
